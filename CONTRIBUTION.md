# Data Science for Business: Code Quality Guide

## 1. Introduction
This guide is intended to help learners produce clean, maintainable, and efficient Python code in the context of data science for business applications.

## 2. Naming Conventions

### 2.1. Variables
Use descriptive names and lowercase, with words separated by underscores. Avoid single-letter names unless in a very localized context (e.g., loop indices).
```python

def calculate_profit_margin(...):
    ...
```

### 2.3. Constants
